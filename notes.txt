Install: - nasm
         - qemu-system-x86

Assemble as binary: nasm -f bin boot.asm -o ./boot.bin
Boot from hard disk(hda): qemu-system-x86_64 -hda ./boot.bin

Notes about Real Mode: 
- In real mode we can access only 1MB of memory!
- Only 16 bits can be accessed at one time 
- Memory is accessed through the segmentation memory model
- Based on the origin x86 design (eg: 8086 processor)
- Absolutely no memory security
- No hardware security

Segmentation memory model:
    - Programs can be loaded in different areas of memory but run t/o problems
    - Multiple segments are available through the sue of segment registers

Segment Registers:
    - CS: Code Segment
    - SS: Stack Segment
    - DS: Data Segment
    - ES: Extra Segment

Calculate absolute position in ram:
    - Take the segment register, multiply it by 16 and add the offset
